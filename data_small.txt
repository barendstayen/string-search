This project studies parallel string search. The goal is to understand how to split data into chunks, run multiple workers, and still detect patterns that cross partition boundaries. Parallel computing is especially useful when text is large. This small file is designed for quick testing. The word "parallel" appears several times. The algorithm should find all matches even when the pattern appears at the end of the text or at the beginning.
